**odesolve**
====

**Background**
-----
Edit a group of codes in Python to help us solve the problems of ordinary differential equations in mathematics.

This document aims to use four functions: Euler, RK4, solveto and odesolve to better solve ordinary differential problems, and more intuitively show the difference between Euler's law and Runge's method.

**Install**
-----
This programme need to be run in anaconda programming environment.

If you don't have this, please click [here](https://www.anaconda.com/) and download it.

**Usage**
-----
The project aims to pass six calculation tests by writing four groups of functions, and draw data pictures with the help of outline.
